* Filename: testFileUnit2.cpp
*
* Revision History:
* Rev. 1 - 25/07/23 Original by A. Chung
*
* Unit Test: Delete functionality in Reservation
* Writes three Reservation records, then deletes the second Reservation record.
* if written correctly, calling a deleteReservation() again on the same record should result in an error
* an exception would be thrown producing a "PASS"
*
* Test Type: Bottom-up integration
* Preconditions:
* - The Reservation file is not used by another module
* - The file may or may not already exist
* - If the file alreaady exists, it must be empty
* - File must have at least 2 or more reservation records
* Test Steps:
* 1. Open file with reservationOpen()
* 2. Create 2 or more reservations
* 3. Write it to file using writeReservation()
* 4. Call deleteReservation() to attempt deletion of the 2nd reservation
* 5. Check again by pulling the same delete function on the same reservation.
* 6. Print "Pass" or "Fail"
